# BDD-Implementation-Exercise

Implement a simple program
using [Behaviour Driven Desgin (BDD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development)
in Python using the [BDD Plugin](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-bdd/) for
the [Python Pytest Framework](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.2.x/)

## Program

I will be designing an implementation of
the [Rosseta Code](https://rosettacode.org/w/index.php?title=Rosetta_Code&oldid=322370) [Magnanimous Numbers Task](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Magnanimous_numbers).

My [Magnanimous-Numbers-Python](https://github.com/Rb1960/Magnanimous-Numbers-Python)
repository will contain the final code, while this repository will contain a
step-by-step list of how I achieved the final code. Each step will be in a named branch.

I have followed the Behavior Driven Python with [pytest-bdd course](https://testautomationu.applitools.com/behavior-driven-python-with-pytest-bdd/) at the Test 
Automation
University (TAU) by @AndyLPK247, using the Pycharm Community Edition.
I plan to document my steps in the project Wiki pages including any problems and
workarounds I encountered.
